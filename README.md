# App Challenges

This simple test should take roughly four hours. 

We’d like you to create a small Android app using the [simple JSON API](http://opendevicelab.com/api-documentation.php) from opendevicelab.com. 

The first view should be a map with place markers for the ODLs. The map should have a location search, as well as using the device’s geolocation. 

Tapping the marker should go to a view with info about each ODL (eg number of devices, list of ratings). 

There should also be a view with all ODLs listed A-Z. This should be filterable (find as you type) and go to the same view as tapping a map marker would. 

The API data should be cached and the app should have an option to manually clear the cache).

Supply the source code and build the app into an apk.

What we’re looking for:
- A solid implementation of native UX
- Well structured, commented code
- Considerations for external factors (eg devices, network)

Have fun!
